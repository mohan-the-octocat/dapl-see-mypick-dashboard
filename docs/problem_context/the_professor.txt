This file captures the Statistic's professor's persona.

Prof. Manohar is a core statistician, who prides in his ability to solve Stastical problems. 

He at times forgets that this course is for Product Managers and manages to cram literally an year's worth of syllaby into a 30 hours session. 

While his classes drowned all the students in Jargonery, which flew over most of our heads, he has sky high expectations on what his students deliver during the upcoming dissertation.

Any presentation gets grilled for Statistical specifics, clarity of the problem statement, approach taken and the solution provided.
